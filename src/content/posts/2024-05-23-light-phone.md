At the beginning of the year I decided to switch to a "dumb phone" called a *Light Phone*, which really is a phone that has limited functionality, i.e. not connected to the internet or app stores.
I did this because I wanted to see if this would make me less addicted to my phone and more productive in life. I'm focused on learning a few languages, attempting to read 100 books this year and creating my music and art as my new vocation (more on this in future posts ðŸ˜„).

# The Details

[The Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) costs about $300 and with their cellular plan of 1 gig a month it costs about $30 a month for service. The phone can become a hotspot for using that data plan but the phone itself doesn't connect to the internet.

It is a small, kindle like black/white e-reader that is beautifully crafted. By design it is meant to help you live without Big Tech companies by avoiding "Surveillance Capitalism" and the "Attention Economy". Their website states **"you are the customer, not the product. This is a phone for humans"**.<br>
How refreshing!

As someone who had already decided to get off of social media (more about that in an upcoming blog article as well) I was already weaned off of tech more than the average person but I found myself compelled to pick up my iphone quite often. Using this Light Phone helped me become more comfortable leaving home without a phone and not always being tied to a phone as an extension of myself.

## Unexpected Benefits

One of my favorite unexpected benefits from this experiment was that I found texting on the light phone to not be as easy and intuitive as it was on a regular smart phone so **I started calling and speaking to people on the phone more often than texting**. This was a very positive component to the switch as I felt more connected to the people in my life and was able to hear their voice and the rich communication context that is lost in texting culture.<br>
<br>
Most people get little sips of connection from text messages and emojis when in reality we want a big gulp of connection through quality time together or long conversations on the phone where we can really feel seen and heard.

## The Challenges

For me, I kept my iPhone as a backup for a few apps that had me needing to bring it along on occasion.

- Google Maps, although there was a GPS option on the Light Phone, it wasn't as effective as using Google Maps. With Google Maps, I could load up directions when I had a WiFi signal and be on my way.
- Lyft/Uber, the convenience of using ride share apps for travel is much more effective than finding a taxi so when I needed a ride I would go back to the iPhone and use it to get around.
- Authenticator App, this one I don't use often but at times it is needed to MFA (multi factor authentication) into sites that are more secure. If you don't use MFA or an Authenticator App I would highly recommend it. It is basically an app that has a 6 digit code that refreshes every 60 seconds that can allow you to securely connect to a site by entering that continuously changing code which no one else has access to.
- Pictures, my old smart phone really started to become more of a camera as I removed most apps and only used these few services.

## Slowing Down

Whenever someone would send me a picture or a hyperlink via text I wouldn't be able to see the picture on the Light Phone or be able to open the hyperlink but there was a cool function that link/picture could get forwarded to my email when the Light Phone is connected to a wifi signal.<br>
<br>

I enjoyed this as artifically slowed me down at times. This ultimately gets to the point of the phone for me. **Life is so much more interesting than these magic light boxes we all carry around with us.** By having to take extra steps to get a picture, by making my phone less addictive in taking away a great deal of functionality I am better able to be present and enjoy the moment without the assistance of an artificial piece of technology.

## Going back

I recently was offered a lower internet rate on my internet service. Spectrum won me over Google Fiber by cutting my internet bill from $80 a month down to $40 and with this they offered a free year of phone service when switching to them. Unfortunately Light Phone doesn't work with Spectrum (they do work with some other providers like T-Mobile/AT&T/Verizon) so I decided to go back to the iPhone.

## Final Reflections

I definitely think I felt happier using the Light Phone, even if there were a few inconveniences and at times I needed to bring the iPhone as a backup. I was less compelled to pick up the smart phone and was able to use my energy and attention in better ways.<br>
<br>
I was in the process of selling a house and I found the need to send videos and pictures a necessity so I ended up using What'sApp on the iPhone backup more often as a means for sending convenient text/audio/video.
<br>
Overall, this was a worthwhile experiment that I would recommend to others.

### The Final Frontier

I have discovered within myself the final frontier that I wish to travel to.<br>
**Not having email on my phone at all.**<br>
I'm interested in checking email once a day, on a scheduled internval. This will increase my productivity and lessen the dopamine hits I get every time I look to see if there is a new message.<br>
<br>
Being so connected with the world has some benefits but ultimately I have found there are a greater set of negative consequences that make creating constraints around our technology a very positive option for health and well being, along with productivity.

If you are interested in exploring this further, I would highly recommend reading one of my favorite books, [*Digital Minimalism*](https://calnewport.com/writing/) by Cal Newport.

My favorite quote from Cal's book is that **"either you choose how you use technology, or the technology will choose for you"**. We live in a world where the billions invested in making technology addictive will require us to make intentional choices on how we use our phone and devices, what choices will you make?
