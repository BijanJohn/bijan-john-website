I recently came back from my first solo international travel trip.
My [yoga studio](https://lizardyoga.com/) (check them out if you are in South Austin!) had a yoga retreat for week in the Chiripos Mountains of Costa Rica.

Some highlights of my **favorite** things I experienced were:

* Speaking Spanish with non English speakers

* Building connection with new friends at my yoga retreat

* Meeting my mentor Ryan for the first time in person

* Experiencing a slower life (Pura Vida!), cleaner air/water/food and fruit that grows everywhere
