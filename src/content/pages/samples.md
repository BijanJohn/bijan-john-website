I've been collecting vinyl records over the years and as a Hip Hop head one of the greatest experiences in listening to old music is to find the original samples/cuts that were used in Hip Hop by the original artist. You might be listening to the radio, or a streaming service or a vinyl record and suddenly understand where an artist took their drum break from, or a bass line or some slice of music from the 70s.

There is a great website called <a href="https://whosampled.com/" target="_blank">whosampled.com</a> where you can search out specific samples and who used what. This page is dedicated to recording some of the personal discoveries I've found when listening to vinyl and discovering the origins of music.

Al Green's **Green is Blue** is a terrific record, front to back. I found this digging for only $4 and one of the best purchases I've ever found. The last track on the record is one of the most beautiful renditions of Summertime, worth checking out.

    - Soon as I listened to this song I knew two songs that both used a guitar riff off this track.
        - Capone-N-Norega - LA.LA,LA.LA
        - Immortal Technique - Creation and Destruction

    - I've heard RZA take some different samples from Al Green before, and this sample jumped out at me as such a cool cut.
        - Ghostface Killah - Iron Maiden
